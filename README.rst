Personas
========


Sarah the Soda Drinker
-------------------------

Details
^^^^^^^

Enjoys spending time with friends and organizes group lunches and dinner, but is not a drinker or extravagant with her meal choices.

Goals
^^^^^

Wants to avoid the inevitable suggestion of just splitting the bill based on number of group members, which causes Sarah to pay significantly more than she’s consumed. She enjoys the company of her friends but doesn’t want to foot the bill constantly.


Problem Scenario
=================

The bill arrives at the end of the night and one person is left in the dark with a pencil and the back of the receipt to try to make sense of each person’s responsibility and tip contribution.

Current Alternatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Taking the time to do the math with a pad and paper in the restaurant. The group can also request individual bills, but is usually required to do so at the start of the meal, and people often forget.

Value Proposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A quickly delivered result considering various tip amounts based on level of service.

User Stories

Sarah’s Story
---------------

As Sarah the Soda Drinker, I want to accurately calculate my portion of the total bill so that I can leave knowing I am not overspending my personal budgets especially on items that I did not order or consume.
